--------
OVERVIEW
--------

libmsntp is a full-featured, compact, portable SNTP library. SNTP (RFC 2030) is
a simplified version of NTP (RFC 1305), which allows precise synchronization of
system clocks over a best-effort network. libmsntp provides SNTP client and
server functionality in a shared library with a simple API.

libmsntp is implemented as a thin layer on top of msntp, N.M. Maclaren's
command-line SNTP utility. msntp is compact, straightforward, and elegant, and
I'm indebted to Nick, and to the Cambridge High Performance Computing Facility,
for providing the msntp source to the public.

BUILDING
--------

To build, open Makefile and uncomment the options for your particular platform.
Then, just type make. If make isn't GNU make, you may need to use gmake
instead. See README.msntp for detailed information.

----------
INSTALLING
----------

To install, type "make install". You may need to be the superuser. libmsntp
installs into /usr/local by default; to install to a different location, edit
the Makefile and change the PREFIX variable.

-----
USING
-----

To use, simply build and install libmsntp, #include <libmsntp.h> in your code,
and pass the -lmsntp flag to gcc. For more information, see libmsntp.h. Also,
example.c is a simple command-line tool that demonstrates how to use libmsntp.
You can build it with "make example".
